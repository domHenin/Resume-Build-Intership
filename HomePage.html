                    My name is Dominic Heningburg, and I'm striving to become a better programmer and computer technician.
                    I enjoy programming in Java, I'm always trying to think of new programs to write in order to test my
                    knowledge using this language. Having the desire to become a computer Technician is something that has
                    brought me down the path of learning to program. I take delight in solving critical issue's on both
                    desktops and laptops. Being able to solve you problem in programming or break/fix is a feeling I appreciate
                    having often.
